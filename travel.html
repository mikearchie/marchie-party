            <h3>Travel</h3>
            <ul style="font-weight: bold">
                <li>The closest airport is Salt Lake City (SLC).</li>
                <li>Uber from the airport to Park City costs about $45. For larger parties, a shuttle service such as My Shuttle may make sense, however I suspect that Uber XL will be most cost effective.</li>
                <li>The bus system within Park City is FREE and quite comprehensive, and Park City itself is quite walkable, so you do not have to rent a car. However, depending on where you stay and your personal preferences, you may choose to do so. Either way is fine!</li>
                <li>As you will see below, we are planning activities for the days leading up to and following the wedding. It would be wonderful if you could arrive in Park City by Thursday, September 8 (if not sooner!) to take advantage of all the fun! We understand that schedule may not work for everyone, so we will look forward to seeing you when we can!</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Accomodations</h3>
            <ul style="font-weight: bold">
                <li>If you are looking to rent a home via Airbnb or VRBO, we recommend that you look in the Park Meadows or Old Town areas. There are lots of great options all over town though, and if you want feedback before booking a place, don’t hesitate to ask Maile or Marion!</li>
                <li>If you are a single person, couple, or small group looking to join a group house, let Maile know! We may be able to help people group up.</li>
                <li>For those who prefer a hotel, we have booked a room block at Park City Peaks Hotel.  The room rate is $135/night for a double queen room. Contact them at 435-649-5000 to finalize your reservation, or contact Maile with questions.</li>
                <li>Park City has many fine luxury hotel options as well. A few we recommend:<ul>
                    <li>Montage Deer Valley – Beautiful mountain setting at the top of Deer Valley. Free smores bar every night!</li>
                    <li>St. Regis Park City – Beautiful mountain setting at the Deer Valley ski area with gorgeous amenities.</li>
                    <li>Main and Sky Park City – Luxury hotel with amazing location, right at the foot of Historic Main Street. Easy walk to shops, dining, bars, etc.</li>
                </ul></li>
