            <h3>Travel</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The closest airport is Salt Lake City (SLC).</li>
                <li>Uber/Lyft from the airport to Park City costs about $45. For larger parties, a shuttle service such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myshuttleparkcityutah.com/">My Shuttle</a> may make sense, however I suspect that Uber XL will be most cost effective.</li>
                <li>The bus system within Park City is FREE and quite comprehensive. Your best bet is to use Google Maps transit directions. Park City itself is quite walkable, so you can do a lot without a car. However, depending on where you stay and your personal preferences, you may choose to rent a car. Either way is fine!</li>
                <li>We are planning <a href="events.html">lots of activities</a> for the days leading up to and following the wedding. For maximum fun, arrive in Park City by Thursday, September 8 (if not sooner!)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Accomodations</h3>
            <ul style>
